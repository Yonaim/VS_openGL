# VS_openGL Ray Tracing Project
Ray-Tracing Project at Konkuk University's Computer Graphics Lecture (Prof. Youngwoon Cha)

## Overview
This is a Ray Tracing project utilizing OpenGL for rendering. The project showcases ray tracing algorithms and displays the results using OpenGLâ€™s function to output images directly to the screen.

## Compilation & Run Instructions

### Requirements:
- Visual Studio (Windows)
- OpenGL library (usually bundled with Visual Studio, but may require additional setup depending on your environment)

### Steps to Compile and Run:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio:**
   - Open Visual Studio and select `File` -> `Open` -> `Project/Solution`.
   - Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and open the project file (usually `.sln`).

3. **Build the Project:**
   - In Visual Studio, go to `Build` -> `Build Solution` or press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to compile the project.

4. **Run the Project:**
   - After the build is complete, run the project by selecting `Debug` -> `Start Debugging` or pressing `F5`.

   The program will render the ray tracing results on the screen using the OpenGL `glDrawPixels` function.
